# This is a website that I built for a podcast that I have created in 2021.
# I wanted to have a website for my podcast, and in order to get one, I had to pay or build myself.
# As a computer science student, I took a course named web programming 1, and within one month and a half in the course, I was able to build this website.
# I mainly used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
# Do not hesitate to drop feedback if you think it is necessary.
